# Problem Statement
# Write a program to input an integer N and print the sum of all its even digits and sum of all its odd digits separately.
# Digits mean numbers, not the places! That is, if the given integer is "13245", even digits are 2 & 4 and odd digits are 1, 3 & 5.
# Sample Input:
# 1234
# Sample Output:
# 6 4

N = int(input())
even = 0
odd = 0
n = N
while(n != 0):
    r = n % 10
    if(r % 2 == 0):
        even = even+r
    else:
        odd = odd+r
    n = n//10
print(even, odd)
